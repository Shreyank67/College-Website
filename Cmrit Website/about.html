                    <h1>| CMR Jnanadhara Trust</h1>
                    <p>The CMR Jnanadhara Trust was established in 1990, as a tribute to the 
                    late Sri Chikka Muniyappa Reddy, a visionary educationalist and philanthropist 
                    who believed that every individual deserves access to a quality education. 
                    In accordance with his vision, the CMR educational institutes were founded to 
                    give every student a chance at an outstanding, value-based and well-rounded education. 
                    The CMR Jnanadhara Trust supports and manages all the activities of the CMR Group of 
                    Institutions.</p>

                    <h1>| CMR Logo</h1>
                    <p>
                        The CMR logo is rooted in Indian tradition, yet rendered in the contemporary 
                        form of the Hamsa, the Swan. The swan is the carrier of Goddess Saraswathi – 
                        the Goddess of Learning.<br>
                        It is said that the Swan with its sensitive beak has the power of discrimination – 
                        an ability to distinguish pure milk from a mixture of milk and water. The wings of the 
                        Swan rendered in the alternating flowing lines of blue and white represent the metaphor 
                        of milk and water. The blue stands for clarity of purpose and the white for purity 
                        of vision. The overall form of the logo radiates and sparkles in the calm, self-contained 
                        posture of the Swan gliding on water.
