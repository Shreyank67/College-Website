                        <p>I am indeed very proud to say that my son K.C.Varun (1st Year B.Tech – CSE) is part of your Alma Mater. The budding engineers are given individual attention to develop their skills by the college’s enthusiastic and encouraging faculty.</p>

                        <p>CMRIT provides a very good platform for not only learning the academic curriculum but also exposes the students to new technologies. The faculty motivates the students to do Mini Projects and various competitions (like Hackathons) act as a building block for a good Engineer.</p>
